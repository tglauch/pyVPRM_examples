This script generates a VPRM input for WRF for a region around the ATTO tower in the Amazon using  MODIS satellite data and the corpernicus land cover map 

The data have been preprocessed to save memory space, but this does not chance anything to the analysis procedure, which is commentend in detail in the script.

The file can be run with:

python vprm_preprocessor_new.py --year 2022 --config ./config/preprocessor_config.yaml

General Note:
 There is no need to convert MODIS HDF4 into Netcdf files for using pyVPRM. You can also use HDF4 files directly. Just make sure rasterio is installed with the correct dependencies.
